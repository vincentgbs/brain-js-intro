This began as a repo to keep track of the neural network/brain.js tutorial available on scrimba (https://scrimba.com/g/gneuralnetworks). I used this repo to keep track of my work and progress in the course. While going through the course, I edited a lot of the code to function in a way that was more comfortable for me. Just a note: I also have a different coding style for the teacher of the course, so a lot of the code in the course will not match the code in this repo, and obviously, some of it will.

After working through the 19-video course, I pivoted this repo to become a front-end sentiment detection/language processing example.
